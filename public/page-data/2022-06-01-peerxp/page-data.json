Our product (VM) provided the core features requested by most customers for 1/10th the price.</p>\n<p>The main features included allowing who can push/merge to what branches at what time (optional), and if it required approval from a list of users/groups. The web app allowed users to configure the rules, and I wrote git hooks in Bash (AAAAHH!!) which would communicate with the GL server and allow/deny actions.</p>\n<p>GL does not provide any feature to group users/repos. Our product did, and this would allow customers to configure settings once and would be applied to all the users/repos in that group.</p>\n<h2>Fun things I built</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>READ THIS!</strong> Since I had to build a lot of Django applciations (we had other projects too), I got annoyed with setting up the email functionality everytime. I wrote an email service/web app that could integrate with the already existing or new Django apps. I just had to make an API call from the web apps rather than set it up individually. My CEO loved it and asked me to implement rate limiting and access tokens with user scopes. A client heard about this and ended up requesting one for themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Initially each individual user had to create a token on GitLab and enter it manually in VM. This led to a couple of issues since the token had to follow a specific format and wasn't exactly the best practice. I decided to look into OAuth, which not only made things more secure but now only the owner/admin of the GitLab server had to authenticate and all the data would be imported from GL into VM. I took the initiative for this switch and the customers loved since it followed best practices and was secure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I suggested a couple of features after discussing with the customers, which included blacklisting certain projects/users on VM since some projects have to comply with certain laws. I implemented this and the customers loved it since they themselves did not realize that they would require this in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Decided to use UUIDs over IDs since this was a SaaS application and certain IDs in URLs could be used to extract info about other customers. I know this sounds basic but this was something I came up with my own and then realized that this is how it's done in the industry. Felt a little proud that I came up with this solution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Git Hooks. But in Bash. Absolute nightmare.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apart from this I would generally take part in meetings to understand the product from a business POV. This helped in identifying features/problems we could possibly run into in the future. I would also raise issues on how features could be exploited by end-users and we would come up with fixes in the planning stage, which is way better than having customers come and complain about it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Time at PeerXP","date":"2022-06-02T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2022-06-01-peerxp/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
