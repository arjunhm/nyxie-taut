### What is a Gatsby template?

Gatsby is a popular open-source framework known for creating fast and efficient websites. In the world of Gatsby, templates are like starter kits that come with ready-made files, settings, and often a basic structure. They provide a solid starting point for web developers, making it easier to begin their projects. These templates can be customized to fit a project's specific needs, making it quicker to start development.

In simple terms, Gatsby takes your content and turns it into a static website. It uses nodes and GraphQL to efficiently fetch and display data. Plus, it allows you to host your website for free using static site hosting services (for example: Vercel, Github Pages, Netlify). This makes hosting easy, resulting in speedy, cost-effective, and low-maintenance websites.
