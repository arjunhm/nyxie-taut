- It takes 1% extra effort to whoop 95% of the people  
- 80-90% of your life is dictated by circumstances of your birth. 
- Rest 10-20% is what you make of it. Literally 10-20% effort is what's required and people are not willing to put that in. Put it in the right things  
- If you focus on one thing only and are sub p95, then what's the point! You're just a good amateur.
- Every advantage gets eliminated by copy cats bc it works. thats a free market of ideas, competition, etc because you are gonna screw your life up for a chance that probably doesnt exist and if it does, you can't take advantage of it

#### Actionable steps

- figure out what you really want to do and where you want to spend the next decade of your life focusing on

- Don't be stupid and do not repeat mistakes

- Make checklist. Refer to [Edbert's Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e5AgPOertzKpAuftbwk4-H-X8LiFVjCZX6svUMkDuwA/)

- Find people you want to be like and copy them.

- Review regularly
  - For LeetCode, review your footage regularly
  - Everything needs to be reviewed. checklist. approach. odds. time spent
  - know where to not go. increase the probability of the next choice being right
