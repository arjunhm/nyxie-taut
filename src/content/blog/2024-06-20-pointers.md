## Overview

I'll try to write anything I find regarding pointers.  

### Using a pointer inside a function

```c
void func(int *p) {
	*p++; // integer pointer by p is incremented
	
	// create ptr to another int
	int x = 10;
	int *xp = &x;
	
	p = xp; // this does not work.
}
```

C passes arguments by value. Essentially it makes a copy of `*p`, and any modifications to `*p` inside the function only affects the pointer inside the function.  
  
To modify a pointer, pass a pointer to a pointer.  
```c
/*
Struct Node
	- int data
	- left *Node
	- right *Node
*/

void func(Node **root) {

	if ((*)root->left == NULL) {
		Node *n = malloc(sizeof(Node));
		n->data = 10;
		(*root)->left = n;
	}
}
```
