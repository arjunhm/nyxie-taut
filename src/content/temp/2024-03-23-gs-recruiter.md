My name is Arjun and I am a graduate student at NJIT pursuing MS in CS. I have 3 years of work experience as a backend developer focusing mainly on Python and Django. You can read more about my work [here](https://arjunhm.github.io/2022-06-01-peerxp/) 

I'm currently diving deep into database internals and other low-level components. I've built my own [buffer pool manager](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2020/notes/05-bufferpool.pdf) and I'm steadily progressing towards developing my own database.

You can follow my progress here at https://arjunhm.github.io/2024-02-01-buffer-pool/



I have applied for the position of Software Engineer (122669) and I have completed the online assessment successfully. Waiting to hear back for the next steps. I am open to other opportunities as well. Do drop a message once you get the chance.
