## Description
A cache simulator where user can define the `set bits`, `line count`, and `block bits`.  
Pass `trace file` as input to get count of hits, misses, and evictions.  
Uses LRU eviction policy.  
Does not store the value in blocks since this is just a simulator.  
Returns number of hits, misses, and evictions.
