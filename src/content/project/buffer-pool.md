# Overview

A database buffer pool manager is a component within a database management system responsible for efficiently managing the storage of data in memory. It caches frequently accessed database pages in a buffer pool, reducing the need to repeatedly fetch data from disk, thereby improving overall system performance by minimizing disk I/O operations.

This repo is my implementation of a database buffer pool manager

## Features
**Buffer Management**: Manages a pool of buffers in memory for storage and retrieval of data pages.  
**Page Fetching**: Supports fetching pages from disk into the buffer pool.  
**Page Pinning and Unpinning**: Implements pinning and unpinning of pages, allowing control over buffer pool pages that should remain in memory.  
**Dirty Page Management**: Tracks and flushes dirty pages (modified pages) back to disk, ensuring data integrity and persistence.  
**FIFO Replacer**: Utilizes a simple FIFO replacer algorithm for page replacement.  

## To-Do
- [x] FIFO Replacer
- [ ] Rewrite in Go (cause why not)
